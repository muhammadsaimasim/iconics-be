-- Supabase exposes the "public" schema through its auto-generated REST API, where
-- the anon key (public by design) is enough to query any table without RLS.
-- Enable RLS with NO policies on every table: anon/authenticated REST access is
-- denied, while this backend (connecting as the table-owning postgres role)
-- is unaffected. Any table added later must also get RLS enabled.
